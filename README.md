# How Computers Count

This project explains how computers represent numbers internally using
bits, bytes, binary, logic gates, and hexadecimal.

## Topics Covered
- What a bit and byte are
- Binary number system
- Binary ↔ decimal conversion
- Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
- Why hexadecimal exists

## Binary Example
Decimal 10:
- 8 + 2 = 10
- Binary: 1010

## Logic Gates
AND: both inputs must be 1  
OR: at least one input must be 1  
NOT: flips the bit  
XOR: outputs 1 when inputs are different

## Why This Matters
Understanding how computers count is essential for:
- Programming
- Debugging
- Cybersecurity
- Memory analysis
